In 2013 I wrote *[How I Compute](/2013/08/how-i-compute/)*.
I reread it recently and was surprised by how much had changed in the last four
years, so I've decided to update it with a few of my new favorite things.

<blockquote class="poem">
Desktops with Linux and IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/kitten/about/">kitten</a><br/>
Shortcuts in i3 and words in Vi written<br/>
Unicode standards normalizing my strings<br/>
These are a few of my favorite things<br/>
</blockquote>

For the most part, if a section didn't change from the last time I did this, I
didn't include it.
As before, this is mostly just a list of my favorite tools; I (generally)
present it without any comment or argument as to why they're better or worse
than anything else.

## General computing

### Operating systems

On my laptop I still run [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) exclusively.
I no longer use Windows even as a photo editing box, although I still can't
pretend that I actually like any of the photo editing software on Linux.
It's just better than having to use Windows.

[XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/) was still my desktop environment of choice, until
recently, but I've been experimenting with [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/) and
think I'll stick with it.
It doesn't feel as polished as XFCE (it doesn't show me display options when I
plug in a <abbr title="Display Port">DP</abbr> cable, doesn't remember my screen
brightness settings when I plug in or unplug the power, is convinced that the
keyboard backlight should always be on every time power settings change, etc.),
but having GTK3 is fantastic.
I also now disable xfcewm (or whatever MATE uses) and use
[i3](https://i3wm.org/) as the window manager.
Though I don't use [Openbox](http://openbox.org/) much these days, I'm still a
big fan of it too.

I still have some legacy machines left over running
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/), but for servers I really prefer
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).

### Photo Editing

These days I mostly don't use any graphical software to edit photos; instead I
use a custom <abbr title="Read–Eval–Print Loop">REPL</abbr> based on
[rawkit](https://rawkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that I imaginatively titled,
[photoREPL](https://github.com/photoshell/photoREPL).
I'd still love to find something that runs on Linux or FreeBSD that's even
remotely comparable to Adobe Lightroom.

### File storage and backups

Most of my storage and backups use a NAS based on
[FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/)
I store backups by either zfs sending snapshots to a remote array, or by using a
tarball encrypted with [GnuPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuPG) (and
uploaded to Amazon Glacier).

### Email and chat

I've swapped over to using [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) for email exclusively.
For chat I still run my own personal server that federates with
[other](http://jabber.at/) [services](https://account.conversations.im/)
using <abbr title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol">XMPP</abbr>
(since last time I've become an editor and council member at the
[<abbr title="XMPP Standards Foundation">XSF</abbr>](https://xmpp.org/)), but
I've swapped my server over to [Prosody](https://prosody.im/) and my client over
to [Mcabber](https://mcabber.com/) on the desktop and
[Conversations](https://conversations.im/) on my phone.
I still use [Irssi](https://irssi.org/) quite heavily for
<abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>, but now pair it with
[ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC).

### Music and videos

For music and videos I mostly rely on
[mplayer](http://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) on my laptop, but also have a
media center setup running [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/).

## Servers and web

### Hosting and servers

Though I still have some legacy servers that are the same as last time
(including the one hosting this blog), I prefer
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or
[<abbr title="Google Cloud Platform">GCP</abbr>](https://cloud.google.com/) for
hosting.
I don't run any services that require Ruby anymore (thank goodness), so the Thin
cluster I used to have to deal with has been torn down.

### DNS and domain names

I have domains registered with [NameCheap](http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=2712)
(Disclaimer: Referral link), [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/), and
[Google Domains](https://domains.google).

For DNS I use <abbr title="Hurricane Electric">HE</abbr>'s
[free DNS](https://dns.he.net/).

### TLS

I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for TLS certs, and have been
ever since the many [StartSSL debacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StartCom#Controversies).
Certs are renewed every few months by a cronjob.

### Blogging and content management

Jekyll was beginning to wear on me, so I finally
[upgraded this blog](/2017/07/moving-to-hugo/) to use
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
I'm not convinced that all these static site generators give you anything (for
simple sites, at least) over a script or makefile that executes some templates
and spits out some HTML files though, so there's a chance I'll simplify it yet
again soon.

Although I do miss [RadiantCMS](http://radiantcms.org/) on occasion (I just wish
it weren't written in Ruby), I no longer use a
<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.

## Development

### Source editing

<abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>s have never really
appealed to me unless you count Vim, which is all I use for editing.
I don't even really use any of the plugins that are so popular; I think I have a
few installed, but generally I forget about them and just shell out if I need
external tools.
It may be a tiny bit of extra work, but it's only a few extra keystrokes, works
everywhere, and doesn't break randomly due to updates or require any
maintenance.
Most developer tooling has just gotten too complicated or doesn't serve enough
of a purpose to be worth it.

### Languages

As far as languages go (pun intended), I more or less exclusively use [Clojure],
[Go], and [Rust] these days.
If a magical space fairy told me I could only use one language for the rest of
time, it would probably be Rust, although its centralized package management is
every bit as bad as all the things that came before it (Python, Ruby, Node,
etc.) so maybe it would be whatever figures out that that's an easy-but-bad idea
first.

## Conclusion

Though I can't imagine my personal preferences for tools and computing are all
that interesting to most people, I do find it nifty to see how others do common
tasks differently from me. Hopefully, when read in that regard, this is at least
a tiny bit useful to someone. What about you? [How do you compute](/about)?
