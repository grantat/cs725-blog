I am writing to you today to urge you to make a public statement in opposition
of the, as yet unnumbered, executive order signed by the president on
27th January, 2017 and titled: “Protecting the Nation from Foreign
Terrorist Entry into the United States”, more commonly known as “the Muslim
ban”.

This executive order has been widely decried by the voters of Texas, and indeed
the nation, as both morally wrong and ineffective at its stated goal of
combating terrorism.
Our own allies in the governments of the French Republic, the Federal Republic
of Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and our
neighbors to the north in the Canadian parliament have condemned the order as
unworthy of the nation that brought freedom from oppression to much of the
world.

Furthermore, I am requesting that you consider supporting any bill proposed in
the coming days by The Honorable Dianne Feinstein rescinding the order and
restricting executive authority as it pertains to immigration.
The rule of law in the United States is based on checks and balances that
prevent any branch of government from overstepping its bounds.
It is the duty of any patriot&mdash;and yours expressly as a United States
Senator&mdash;to act as a check against the powers of hate, nationalism, and
fear that threaten to consume our national identity.

Today I call on you to remember and honor _The New Colossus_ and what
may be the most enduring description of American greatness ever penned, “and her
name \ Mother of Exiles.  From her beacon-hand \ Glows world-wide welcome”.
Please lift the lamp of freedom, and keep open America's “golden door”.

Sincerely,  
Samuel Whited
