<div>
<p>
We danced to a tune, by light of the moon,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒThe fiddle was lively and gay.<br/>
A buoy-bell rang in the swell,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒAnd laughing we ran through the spray.
</p>

<p>
The wind in your hair, was fairer than fair,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒWhen you gave my hand a soft squeeze.<br/>
With sand in our toes, we cast off our cloths,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒAnd naked we danced, to our hearts ease.
</p>

<p>
The seabirds were wailing, the night wind was failing,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒwhen at last we lay on the ground.<br/>
A fire was burning, in our hearts: a yearning<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒTo sing for the joy that we'd found!
</p>

<p>
There long we lay, till the slow break of day,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒThen you stood and turned to the sun:<br/>
"I must away, no more can I stay,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒOur lives can never be one".
</p>

<p>
A darkness took me, as storms shook the sea,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒThe earth split as I looked around,<br/>
Searching for you, the life that I knew,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒBut that was no where to be found.
</p>

<p>
I searched in vain, lost in my pain<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒSeeking a way, begging you to stay.<br/>
My days were done, no more would we run,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒThat time would never return.
</p>

<p>
Long time I walked, to no man I talked;<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒA shadow of whomever I was,<br/>
By the sea haunted, by leaving it daunted,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒUntil waves that once rolled lie still.
</p>

<p>
And still must I seek; with you longing to speak,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒNo more to hear your voice by the dunes.<br/>
Through blind night I stalk, to the worlds end I walk,<br/>
â€ƒâ€ƒUnable to dance under the moon.
