Desktops with Linux and [IETF kitten]  
Shortcuts in i3 and words in Vi written  
[Unicode standards] normalizing my strings  
These are a few of my favorite things

<!--more-->

Well tested functions and prompt SEV1 fixes  
scrypt and bcrypt and [NAS with Unixes]  
Servers with segfaults nowhere to be seen  
These are a few of my favorite things

Git popping cleanly and clearing my stashes  
Resources that skip disk and serve from my caches  
[Jabber connections] with minimal pings  
These are a few of my favorite things

When unaligned bytes  
Or spam offerings  
Have me going mad  
I simply remember my favorite things  
And then I don't feel so bad
